    EEOC v. Walmart 6:20-cv-00163 (E.D. Ky.) | Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse
    The consent decree applied to all Walmart grocery distribution centers. The decree provided injunctive relief, including requiring Walmart to cease use and refrain from using for five years a physical abilities test for hiring order fillers at grocery distribution centers. Walmart was also forbidden from engaging in employment practices that discriminate on the basis of sex and from engaging in employment practices that discriminate on the basis of involvement in the EEOC proceedings, the proceedings on the claim against Walmart, or any other proceeding under Title VII.
    The consent decree also provided significant monetary relief. The decree ordered Walmart to pay $20,000,000.00 into a Qualified Settlement Fund as part of the resolution, to be distributed to eligible claimants at the sole discretion of the EEOC. Eligible claimants include women who applied for the position of orderfiller at a Walmart grocery distribution center between February 1, 2020 and the time Walmart ceased use of the physical abilities test and who did not score competitively on the physical abilities test, and therefore did not move forward in the hiring process for the position of orderfiller. The decree also shifts the costs of a claims administrator up to $250,000.00 to Walmart, allowing a mutually agreed upon claims administrator to oversee the claims process and payments to eligible claimants. The consent decree also awarded the EEOC costs for the action.
    Further, the consent decree mandated certain training and notification requirements. The decree required Walmart to provide training to employees who have hiring or supervisory responsibilities for grocery orderfillers regarding the terms of the consent decree including the cessation of the physical abilities test, clear and accurate information about the grocery orderfiller job requirements and qualifications, and information on what constitutes unlawful employment practice under Title VII. Walmart was also required to certify compliance with certain aspects of the consent decree in writing to the EEOC.
